# Computer Science Resources

A list of useful resources for learning computer science.

## Introductions to Computer Science

[Harvard's CS50](http://cs50.org/) is an excellent resource for everyone. David Malan is a fantastically energetic and passionate about teaching, which makes a world of difference to students! You cover all the important stuff in a very digestible way. Interestingly, students start off with one assignment in Scratch, MIT's drag and drop programming language. Students then move to C, and learn about memory, big O, pointers and more! Finally, the course finishes up with Python, SQL and web programming. This is such a good all-rounder course.

[Udacity's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101) is a wonderful course, one of my favourites. Using Python, you get to explore more about programming language fundamentals. I feel like most people would find the learning curve steeper than the CS50 course. You start off with building a web scraper, and finish by creating a basic search engine. One of the best units is Problem Solving, where you really work out how to break down problems, and iterate on them.

## Learning Web Development

[Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)'s site has everything you need to know!

[Google's codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?cat=Web) have some really great tutorials, from building progressive web applications to learning Web Assembly.

## Tech Interview Problems

[Hacker Rank](www.hackerrank.com) is really handy for brushing up on problems from a particular domain.

[CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/java) is a nice resource I found by trawling through the [Google Techdev Guide](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/). It's not as pretty as some of the other sites, but there's a really good selection of problems and I'm enjoying going through it!

[LeetCode](leetcode.com) is apparently one of the best practice interview sites - I'm pretty invested boosting my imaginary points in HackerRank for the time being.

[InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) is a great site, but I don't really like the way everything is timed.

[Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/) has some great free problems, but the professional edition is very expensive. I really like how they've added in the different hints from solving the problem to work up to an optimal solution. Their email list is work subscribing to.

## Python

[Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/web-frameworks.html) seems like a really great resource for learning more about web frameworks, and just Python in general - I'm very much looking forward to investigating this properly.

[Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming) explains more advanced python concepts in a readable way, I liked how the content was presented.

## Regex

[Rubular](http://rubular.com/r/UAgzl9NxQv) is great for playing around with regexes to get a feel for how they work.
