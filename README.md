# Computer Science Resources

A list of useful resources for learning computer science.

# Learning Web Development

[Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)'s site has everything you need to know!

[Google's codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?cat=Web) have some really great tutorials, from building progressive web applications to learning Web Assembly.

## Tech Interview Problems

[Hacker Rank](www.hackerrank.com) is really handy for brushing up on problems from a particular domain.

[LeetCode](leetcode.com) is apparently one of the best practice interview sites.

[InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) is a great site, but I don't really like the way everything is timed.

[Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/) has some great free problems, but the professional edition is very expensive. I really like how they've added in the different hints from solving the problem to work up to an optimal solution. Their email list is work subscribing to.

## Python

[Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/web-frameworks.html) seems like a really great resource for learning more about web frameworks, and just python in general.

[Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming) explains more advanced python concepts in a readable way, I liked how the content was presented.

## Regex

[Rubular](http://rubular.com/r/UAgzl9NxQv) is great for playing around with regexes to get a feel for how they work.
